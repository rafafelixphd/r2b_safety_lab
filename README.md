### Bridging General Activity Learning and Safety in Low-Cost Robotics

## 🌟 Vision & Philosophy

The **R2B (Robotic Risk Bench)** project is founded on a core belief: **Robotic safety must be achieved jointly with general activity learning and world modeling.** Safety should not be an afterthought or a separate "wrapper" around an agent; it must be an intrinsic part of how robots interact with and learn from their environment. We aim to decompose this challenge into actionable engineering steps, improving academic research and supporting the community in reliabily deploy safer robots to the physical world.

## 🏗️ Current Focus: SO-ARM101

### The bench is currently in the V1 phase.

We are currently utilizing the **SO-ARM101** platform.

- **Why?** Its open-source nature and low-cost entry point make it the ideal "hackable" candidate for stress-testing safety protocols.
- **Challenge:** Low-cost servos often lack the deterministic feedback of industrial actuators. We are documenting how to bridge this "Reliability Gap" through better perception and control.

## 🧪 Research & Development Areas

### 1. Safety-Aware Learning

How can we reward a model for task success while penalizing "near-miss" safety violations? We are experimenting with different simulation environments to find the optimal balance of speed, low-cost overhead, and physical accuracy.

### 2. Computer Vision for Robotics (CVRS 101)

As part of this repository, I am developing **Lecture Notes: Computer Vision for Robotic Systems 101**.

- Focus: Real-time object detection, depth estimation, and visual servoing for safety-critical tasks.
<!-- - [View Lecture Notes Directory](./lectures/CVRS_101) _(Work in Progress)_ -->

### 3. Simulation to Reality (Sim2Real)

Evaluating simulators (Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, Gazebo) for their ability to model failure modes—not just success paths.

## 📁 What to Expect from this Repository

- **Open-Source Training Material:** Guides and weights for training the robots.
- **Safety Trends:** Curated insights and summaries from the latest academic literature on robotic safety.
- **Technical Benchmarks:** Documentation on the latency and reliability of low-cost robotic components.
- **Educational Content:** Full course materials for CVRS 101.
